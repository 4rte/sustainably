ECOALF,"Because there is no planet B! Berlinâ€™s ethical fashion crowd rejoiced when the new flagship store of Spanish-born label Ecoalf opened its doors in 2017. Located in the heart of Mitteâ€™s go-to area for trendy clothing labels, Ecoalf proves that wasting the natural resources of our planet to look good is so yesterday. Instead, the certified BCorp is transforming plastic waste, fishing nets and coffee grounds into high-quality upcycled clothing. Frustrated by the overuse and overproduction in the Western world and a strong urge to leave the world better for his son Alfredo (hence why the name), president and founder Javier Goyeneche decided to create the first fashion line that only uses recycled materials. All while achieving the same quality and modern design as the best non-recycled ones and building a new generation of conscious consumers.

SHIO ,"Did you know that there is 10 to 20% of waste generated in each step of the textile and clothing production? Thank god, there are some passionate designers out there who want to change that. Like Kate Pinkstone, owner of the beautiful SHIO Store. All her designs have a strong focus on upcycling - taking garments that are already there and giving them a new life by improving elements and cuts. We are big fans of Kateâ€™s creations, as they are absolutely timeless, pure and wearable everyday (as opposed to the sometimes very extravagant patterns and shapes of other upcycling brands). To find materials, she strolls over flea markets and always keeps an eye on whatâ€™s high quality and will last a long time."," Weichselstrasse 59, 12045 Berlin",http://www.shiostore.com/,Clothes
